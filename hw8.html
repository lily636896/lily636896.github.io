    <h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>
    <p>
        AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
        In this script, when you click the "Get CD collection" button, an AJAX request is made to retrieve an XML file containing CD data.
        The XMLHttpRequest object is used to send the request, and when the response is received, the data is processed and displayed in a table.
        This allows for fetching data from a server without requiring a full page reload.
